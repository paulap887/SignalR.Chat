# Real-Time Chat Application with .NET Core and Vue!
## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

- `SignalR.Chat.API`: Contains the server-side code for the chat application built with .NET Core.
- `chatclient/signalrchatclient`: Contains the client-side code for the chat application built with Vue.

## Getting Started

To run the chat application locally, follow these steps:

### Server-Side Setup

1. Navigate to the `SignalR.Chat.API` folder.
2. Open the solution file (`SignalR.Chat.API.sln`) in your preferred development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Build the solution to restore NuGet packages and compile the code.

### Client-Side Setup

1. Navigate to the `chatclient/signalrchatclient` folder.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in this directory.
3. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
 ```bash
   npm install
  ```
  
## Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, follow these steps to run the chat application:

### Server-Side

1. Start the server-side application by running the project using your development environment (e.g., Visual Studio) or by using the command line.

### Client-Side

1. Navigate to the `chatclient/signalrchatclient` folder.
2. Run the following command to start the client-side application:

 ```bash
   npm run serve
  ```
 
3. Open your preferred web browser and visit the URL displayed in the terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
